# advent2022-prolog
Hi! I decided to do Advent of Code 2022 (or as much as I can with my free time) entirely in prolog
Here are the below language implementations for Advent of Code 2022:
1: Python
2: Python
3: C++ to parse into LISP usable list, then remainder LISP
4: Prolog (at first used C++ to parse string into Prolog usable list, but have since then used exclusively Prolog)
5: Prolog
6:*Prolog (at first used C++ to create prolog code for part two, but instead have gone back and created it generalized and with exclusively Prolog)
7: Prolog
8:*Prolog
9: Prolog

*I would recommend using Prolog on these days
